# oodham_bigram_model
Simple bigram model for small dataset of Tohono O'odham sentences.
This bigram model generates novel sentences based on bigram probabilities. Some are correct and others are ungrammatical.
Ungrammaticity arises from the model's inability to capture subject-verb number dependencies.

Sentences from Ofelia Zepeda's _A Papago Grammar_.
